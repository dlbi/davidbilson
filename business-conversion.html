        <p>Website conversion rates is around 2 percent on the average. For every 10 visitors, you can expect to only get 2 customers. And honestly, that is a pretty good conversion rate.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Many sites only have a 0.1% to 0.2% conversion rate. That takes 1000 visitors to get 1 customer. How then do we improve our conversions so we can get more customers with the traffic we already have?<br>the best proven ways have been carefully selected from research and we shall be going through them together;</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li>1. Add a pop-up event to your site</li>
            <li>2. Remove unneccessary form fields</li>
            <li>3. Add testimonials, reviews, logos</li>
            <li>4. Remove distractions</li>
            <li>5. Make the initial steps really easy</li>
            <li>6. Add a third party sign up service</li>
            <li>7. Strengthen your CTA copy</li>
            <li>8. Add live chat to your site</li>
            <li>9. Try another offer</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>1. Add a pop-up event to your site</h2>
        <p>According to a research study, the average conversion rate for all pop-ups is 3.09 percent. However, if you do it the right way, you can reach the top 10 percent of pop ups which average 9.28 percent conversion rate.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This one change can boost your conversion rate. it works on every site i've ever worked with. <br>Here are some quick tips for getting the highest conversion rate from pop ups;</p><br>
        <ol>
            <li>- Try several offers like PDFs, premium content, different products, other freee stuffs, until you find a winner you can feel right away.</li>
            <li>- Put a 30 second delay timer on the pop up, that is it should only come up 30 seconds after the user has been on the site. This prevents the pop up from being annoying.</li>
            <li>- Make it easy to close the pop up right away</li>
            <li>- Set a cookie so the pop-up only appears once per user. Most pop-up tools allow you to do this</li>
        </ol>

        <p>This combination will give you a huge boost in conversions and keep the complaints to zero. you won't annoy anyone and you'd get all the benefits. <br> The impact on your conversions will be so large that you could skip the rest of the list.</p><br>

        <h2>2. Remove unneccessaary form fields</h2>
        <p>If you have ever heard the intention of filling out an online form, just to be scared awa by too many required fields, then you should read this.</p>
        <br>
        <p>It's one of the best ways to kill your conversion rate. remove all unnecessary form fields, leaving only those that are essential to accomplishing your goals.</p>
        <p>If your sales team doesn't get the lead info that they need to follow up, your signups could be super high but your close rate will be trash. So, find the right balance between getting the critical lead info while keeping the fields to a minimum. Jusst makesure every field plays a critical role. If not, remove it.</p><br>

        <h2>3.Add testimonials, reviews, logos</h2>
        <p>No one wants to be the first person to use a product or service. So you can put their mind at ease by providing testimonials and/or reviews from past customers. Testimonials in quotes such as <br><br>
        <q>Neil patel  digital is one of the few consultants companies that's worth their fees</q><br><br>
    For homepages, you can also add a series of logos that instantly build trust with new visitors: Logos can be DELL, Etsy, Mint, Hp,Amazon etc</p>
        <br>
        <p>Social proof including testimonials, puts customers at ease. In an interview with ConversionXL, growth marketing expert Angie Schottmuller said " If quality social proof buffers notable uncertainty, get ready for some remarkable conversion impact - in some cases up to 400% improvement"</p>
        <p>Every critical page on your testimonials, reviews or logos</p><br>

        <h2>4. Remove distractions</h2>
        <p>There is nothing worse than a website that pulls you in too many directions <br> Your landing page should be clear, concise and easy to navigate. If it's not essential, don't include it. Stick to what your visitors need to know and nothing else. If possibe, your landig page should only include; <br><ol>
            <li>- Headline and subheadings</li>
            <li>- Benefits and features</li>
            <li>- Testimonial and reviews</li>
            <li>- Visuals combined with context, which shows what you are offering</li>
        </ol></p>
        <br>
        <p>There are other things to consider such as a live chat box, social proof and video. The main point remains the same; eliminate all distraactions. You want your visitors focused on your offer and nothing else. </p>
        <p>You can use analytic tools to show you which lnks and which elements your user or visitors interacts with</p><br>

        <h2>5. Make the initial steps really easy</h2>
        <p>Humans prefer to finish things that they started</p>
        <br>
        <p>So, when it comes to your offer, the first step should be extremely simple to complete.</p>
        <p>Instead of asking for an entire form to be filled out, simply request an email address to start. From there, you can provide the rest of the form in hopes of securing additional information. But even if you don't, you will still have the person's email. <br>The easier you make the initial step, the greater the chance there is of your visitor taking action and following through to the end.</p><br>

        <h2>6. Add a third-party signup service</h2>
        <p>Alternative logins have become quite popular.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Instead of creating a new profile from scratch, a user logs in using their Google, Facebook or any other account. This eliminates the signup form altogether. </p>
        <p>You will see an immediate impact on o=your conversion rate.</p><br>
        <br>
        <h2>7. Strengthen your CTA (call to action) copy</h2>
        <p>CTAs like "sign up" and "start trial" won't give you the best conversion rates.</p>
        <br>
        <p>A few minutes spent improving the sales copy will give you an easy conversion rate win. </p>
        <p>Start with a CTA that starts with the word "Yes"<. It's highly effective psychologically because it paints the offer  in a positive light. Something like the button below;</p>
        <br>
        <button style="padding:14px 30px;background:red;color:whitesmoke;font-size:18px;border:none;border-radius:5px;font-weight:600px;">Yes, i want my discount!</button><br><br>
        <p>You can try this formula: Yes, i want [your offer/product]!</p>
        <p>It works a lot better than generic CTA copy.</p><br><br>

        <h2>8. Add live chat to your site</h2>
        <p>Many visitors want to buy your service but are on the fence.</p>
        <br>
        <p>They have a lingering doubt or question that keeps them from taking that last step.</p>
        <p>Live chat bots or tools are perfect for helping these folks.</p><br>
        <p>Just like a pop-up, live chat tools are easy to add on any site and have an immediate boost to your versions</p>
        <br><br>
        <h2>9. Try another offer</h2>
        <p>Don't pay so much attention to your landing page design, copy and related factors that you overlook the importance of choosing the right offer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>This has one of the biggest impacts o conversion rates, as your offer must be appealing to the market</p>
        <p>If your conversion rate is on the low side, cycle through different offers until you find something that clicks with your audience.</p><br>
        <p>It may not be the firstm second or even third offer that resonates wuth your market. But if you continue to experiment and track your results, you will eventually find a winner.</p>
