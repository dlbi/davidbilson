        <p>If you really want to be a great developer, there are some key qualities you must have.</p><br>
        <p>Although there are plenty jobs out there, we cannot overlook the fact that the competition is fierce.</p>
        <p>A budding software developer still has to be at the top of their game and stand out from the crowd in order to get their dream job.</p>
        <p>According to the CEO of <b style="color: red;">CODEFIGHTS</b>, Tigran Sloyan, there are seven important qualities that all successful developers must have.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Be a team player</h2>
        <p>Developers who are team players are more likely to be successful in their career than lone-rangers. There is a pop culture stereotype of the brilliant but emotionally stunted programmer - someone who can pu; of fears of code heroically but can't connect with the people around them.</p>
        <p>This doesn't work in real engineering teams. As a developer, your job is to solve issues  and create a great product, not just to write as many clever lines of codes as possible. That means communication with all kinds of people such as other developers, quality assurance, PMs, sales, customers etc is of high essence.</p>
        <p>Remeber to treat others with sympathy and respect. Be the kind of developoer who works well and lifts up everyone around you, not just the one that works well in isolation.</p>
        <br>
        <h2>Stay humble</h2>
        <p>Developers that are successful never forget to drop their egos at home. No matter how good you are at what you do, you are not always going to be right. Other team members might have constructive criticism during code review, or your code might have bugs that you onli find out about after shipping the product.</p>
        <p>Whenever this happens, you have to be <b>OKAY</b> with other people pointing out and correcting your errors. That is why humility is such an important quality for developers to have.</p>
        <p>The ability to be humble and take criticism and corrections from others and then channeling it into learning what you can do beter will surely make you a much better developer in the long run.</p><br>
        <h2>Practice makes perfect</h2>
        <p>Successful developers keeps their skills sharp. You have to put in the time and effort to sharpen your skills.</p>
        <p>Many professional developers try out new languages or keep up their grasp of programmng using diffeent algorithms or data structure.</p>
        <p>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Inventore fugiat tenetur esse quo et velit nostrum aut voluptates dignissimos, doloribus tempora! Voluptatibus repudiandae, soluta rem consectetur eveniet iure temporibus voluptatum.</p><br>

        <h2>Invest in your own work</h2>
        <p>Developers who feel a personal sense of investment and pride in the work that they do tend to be much more successful than the ones who don't.</p>
        <p>Outstanding developers are much like outstanding artists. What they are creating is not just work they do to collect a cheque. They always have a sense of craftmanship and authorship.</p>
        <p>That fuels them to go the extra mile to make si=ure thier work is of high qualtiy. On the other hand, if you're half-assing it or aren't fully invested in what you're doing, your work and the project will suffer as a result.</p><br>

        <h2>Keep an eye on the bigger picture</h2>
        <p>Successful developers keeps their skills sharp. You have to put in the time and effort to sharpen your skills.</p>
        <p>Many professional developers try out new languages or keep up their grasp of programmng using diffeent algorithms or data structure.</p>
        <p>Lorem, ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Inventore fugiat tenetur esse quo et velit nostrum aut voluptates dignissimos, doloribus tempora! Voluptatibus repudiandae, soluta rem consectetur eveniet iure temporibus voluptatum.</p><br>
